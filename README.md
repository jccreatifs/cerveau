Programming notes.

This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault used to contain my notes about web development. 

Obsidian is a note-taking app with notes that can be linked together, like the Internet. It's cool I know.

*The tone of my notes here is like I am talking to myself in the third person, if that makes sense. The idea is that when I think I am teaching what I learned to someone else, this exercise does something illuminating and I have more opportunities to spot gaps in my understanding of the topic than to just write down notes for myself like a scribe.*

## Tools
For web development, you have to set up your local dev environment. It's the place where you write, run, and test codes.
