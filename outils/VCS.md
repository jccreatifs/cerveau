# Version Control Systems

*Version control* is a system that records changes to a file(s) you are working on so that you can recall specific versions later, like a time machine scale of **undo button**.

**Git** is the version control we'll be using for local "snapshots" (the versions you choose to save as your options later in case you want to undo at some specific points during your project development) and **Github** is a celestial place of data heaven where you can save your *version controlled* projects, or better called "repositories".

### Installing git
```shell
sudo apt install git
```

After installing git, you can set your name and email address with the following command.

For setting up your git user name:
```shell
git config --global user.name "Charles Sanders Peirce"
```

For setting up you git user email address:
```shell
